                <p>

                    "My practice is currently focused on municipal court defense matters, including marijuana possession, insurance violations, driving while suspended/revoked and speeding tickets. Most matters can be resolved before court, but I have and will take cases to trial if necessary. Call or text me for a free consultation."
